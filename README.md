# Project Time Management

Project Time Management is an app designed to help users reduce their screen time. This application not only tracks your screen time but also allows you to compete with friends through rankings. Each user sets a desired screen time limit, and if this limit is exceeded, a visual metaphor of a 'bread dying' is displayed as a fun and engaging reminder of the goal. The app aims to make screen time management more interactive and socially motivated.
